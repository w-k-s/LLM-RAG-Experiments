# LLM RAG Experiments

Playing around with Retrieval Augmented Generation.

## Next Steps

- [x] Go through [first tutorial](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/27_first_rag_pipeline)
- [x] Try this with my own dataset (e.g expenses csv)
- [ ] Understand the pipeline connections (draw a diagram)
- [ ] Make it interactive, with the abiliy to add documents and add questions about newly added documents
- [ ] What are the different configurations and what do they mean?

##Â Questions

- In Lesson 2, Why did we initialise the InMemoryDocumentStore with `BM25Plus` and use `InMemoryBM25Retriever`?
